# Answer:
To efficiently handle playlist updates and avoid downloading unmodified media files, we can implement a strategy that compares the modified timestamp from the server with the previously stored timestamp in local storage (either SharedPreferences or a database like Room).

When the app first receives the playlist data from the server, we save the modified timestamp (which indicates the last time the playlist was updated) in local storage (SharedPreferences or Room).
Additionally, we save the playlist data (including media files such as images and videos) locally on the device for future use.
Checking for Updates:

On subsequent refreshes (e.g., when the user manually refreshes the playlist, or through a background task like WorkManager), the app fetches the playlist data again from the server.
We then compare the new modified timestamp (from the server response) with the one stored locally.
Deciding Whether to Refresh or Use Cache:

If the new modified timestamp is greater than the one stored in local storage, it means the playlist has been updated. In this case:
We fetch the updated playlist data from the server.
We update the local storage with the new playlist data and the new modified timestamp.
We download any new or updated media files (e.g., images and videos) from the server and store them locally.
If the modified timestamp is the same or older, we simply load the cached playlist data and media files, avoiding unnecessary downloads.
Transparency to the User:

The user will not notice whether the app is fetching new data or loading cached data, as the process is transparent. They will always see the most up-to-date playlist and media without redundant downloads.
This approach helps in saving network bandwidth and improves the app's performance, especially in scenarios with large media files.
By storing the modified timestamp locally and comparing it with the server's response, we ensure that we only download new or updated data when necessary, providing an efficient and seamless user experience.

Server-Side Suggestions:

# In addition to the client-side approach of comparing the modified timestamp, there are a couple of server-side strategies that can optimize the process of detecting playlist updates and minimizing unnecessary data transfer:

Use HTTP Status Code 304 (Not Modified):

Description: When the client requests the playlist data, the server can return a 304 Not Modified status code if the playlist has not changed since the last request.
How It Works:
The client sends a GET request to the server along with the If-Modified-Since header, which includes the timestamp of the last time the playlist data was fetched (stored locally in the client).
If the server detects that the playlist has not been modified since that timestamp, it responds with a 304 status code, indicating that the client can continue using the cached version of the playlist data.
This approach minimizes unnecessary data transfers by ensuring that only modified data is sent to the client.
Benefits:
Reduces network overhead and speeds up the response time, as the server avoids sending the entire playlist data when there have been no changes.
Simplifies the logic on the client-side since the client only fetches new data when needed.


# Implement GraphQL with Subscriptions and Mutations:

Description: Another approach is to leverage GraphQLâ€™s subscription mechanism to listen for real-time changes to the playlist data on the server side. The server can notify the client only when there are actual modifications, using a GraphQL mutation to signal changes.
How It Works:
The client subscribes to a mutation (or subscription) that listens for updates to the playlist or media files.
When a modification occurs on the server, such as the addition, removal, or update of a media item, the server pushes the update to the client via the GraphQL subscription, notifying the client of the change.
The client then fetches only the modified data (e.g., new media files or updated playlist items) as necessary, without needing to refresh the entire playlist.
Benefits:
Provides real-time synchronization between the client and server, ensuring that the client always has the most up-to-date data without needing to repeatedly poll the server.
Minimizes unnecessary downloads, as the client only receives the data that has changed.
Reduces server load by avoiding frequent polling for changes.
